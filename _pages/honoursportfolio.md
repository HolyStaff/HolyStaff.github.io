<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<h1 style="max-width: 500px">What I did: </h1>
    I developed a complete game concept including original character designs, 
    a detailed worldbuilding, and an engaging narrative. 
    The characters were crafted with distinct visual styles and personalities, 
    while the game world was built with its own history and aesthetic rules. 
    The storyline tied all elements together to create an immersive experience.
    
<h1>Why I did it: </h1>
    Game design sits at the intersection of my passions: storytelling, 
    creativity, gaming, and coding. By developing this project, I aimed to:

    Strengthen my skills in character and world design.
    Explore game design with a focus on storytelling.
    Prepare for future projects where I can integrate 3D modeling, 
    coding (in Godot for example), and creative writing.
