## Project Summary


# What you did:
```For this project I made a design for a game, more specifically I designed a storyline with characters and a world setting, including the appropriate visuals for these where possible. At the start I came up with some small possible game ideas and chose one of them. I landed on a story-line focused game. For this game design I then made a weekly schedule and divided the game into, storyline, main character & main villain, world (setting), enemies, side characters.```
**Game summary:
**Title: Royal Amnesia
Story:
```You play as X, a young man who has been living in the jungle for the last 2 years and has no prior memories. One day he comes across people from the capital who are wandering in the jungle and the moment they recognize X they start attacking him. X manages to escape but sets off to a journey to the capital to uncover his past and face the consequences of who he was before.```
You as the player get to uncover X’s past together to find out what happened and your choices will greatly impact the fate of the entire kingdom.
**Genres: ```Fantasy (monsters, mediaval times, kingdoms, magic), Branching-Narrative (Your choices as a player affect the story), Psychological Thriller (As you decide what is wrong and right and who is right as you uncover the past)```

# Why you did it:
```This project was my first chance to really try out the designing part of a project (well the whole project is design) where as before it would be more the technical side. Game design has always been a fascination of mine and this was a perfect opportunity to give it a shot. I really enjoyed this project and will also enroll into the game–design minor because of it.```
# What you learned & how it contributed to your competence (or not):
```In this project I think the most present skill was the workflow, learning to do what in what order, how to make certain decisions like what colors to use, and how to design certain characters. I cannot say with certainty that it improved my creativity or creative skills for I find that difficult to measure, however I think the (coming back on the workflow) the way I handle creative tasks has improved. I have done creative assignments for school before in a sense of writing but not visual design, and while I think the way I approached it was satisfactory I know I would do it better having gained this experience.
This all fitted perfectly with my goal to develop myself in the more creative side, and especially the storytelling which was my goal at the start of this lab.```
