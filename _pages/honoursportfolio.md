## Project Summary


# What you did:
```For this project I made a design for a game, more specifically I designed a storyline with characters and a world setting, including the appropriate visuals for these where possible. At the start I came up with some small possible game ideas and chose one of them. I landed on a story-line focused game. For this game design I then made a weekly schedule and divided the game into, storyline, main character & main villain, world (setting), enemies, side characters.```
### Game summary:
#### Title: Royal Amnesia
#### Story:
```You play as X, a young man who has been living in the jungle for the last 2 years and has no prior memories. One day he comes across people from the capital who are wandering in the jungle and the moment they recognize X they start attacking him. X manages to escape but sets off to a journey to the capital to uncover his past and face the consequences of who he was before.```
<br>You as the player get to uncover X’s past together to find out what happened and your choices will greatly impact the fate of the entire kingdom.
<br>Genres: ```Fantasy (monsters, mediaval times, kingdoms, magic), Branching-Narrative (Your choices as a player affect the story), Psychological Thriller (As you decide what is wrong and right and who is right as you uncover the past)```

# Why you did it:
```This project was my first chance to really try out the designing part of a project (well the whole project is design) where as before it would be more the technical side. Game design has always been a fascination of mine and this was a perfect opportunity to give it a shot. I really enjoyed this project and will also enroll into the game–design minor because of it.```
# What you learned & how it contributed to your competence (or not):
```In this project I think the most present skill was the workflow, learning to do what in what order, how to make certain decisions like what colors to use, and how to design certain characters. I cannot say with certainty that it improved my creativity or creative skills for I find that difficult to measure, however I think the (coming back on the workflow) the way I handle creative tasks has improved. I have done creative assignments for school before in a sense of writing but not visual design, and while I think the way I approached it was satisfactory I know I would do it better having gained this experience.
This all fitted perfectly with my goal to develop myself in the more creative side, and especially the storytelling which was my goal at the start of this lab.```

# Competencies:
## Expression & Literacy
```This project was all about taking my thoughts and ideas and showing them to others through the game's story and how it looked. By creating the storyline, characters, and world, and adding pictures, I practiced getting my ideas across in a way that people can understand in today's world where there's lots of information and ways to communicate. I want to get better at design so I can share my ideas, especially characters and creatures, and let people experience them. Showing things visually is a strong way to do this.```
## Curiosity & Initiative
```During this project, I learned that designing something takes a lot of thought and time. Because I was curious about how to design games well, I looked up information and found helpful videos from Riot Games that explained all the steps and things to think about. Even though it seemed like a lot at first, it made me even more interested. Also, I decided to focus only on the design part of the project since I already know how to code. This shows I took the initiative to learn and grow in an area I wanted to improve in.```
## Innovation & Creativity
```The hardest part of this project was probably when I had trouble coming up with ideas. It's like a switch, sometimes I can draw non-stop and lots of ideas pop into my head, but other times, nothing comes out at all. This happened several times during this project, and it made me realize that sometimes you have to keep working even when it's tough. You can't always wait for ideas to just appear. I learned that sometimes you need to try different things, look at what others have done, or just keep sketching until something starts to click. Even when I felt stuck, I kept trying to find new ways to design the characters and the world for my game. This experience taught me that being creative isn't always easy, but you have to keep pushing through those moments when ideas don't come easily.```
# Conclusion:
```All in all, this project was a great way for me to really dive into the creative side of game design, which is something I’ve been wanting to explore more seriously. It gave me the chance to experiment with storytelling, world-building, and visual design in a way that felt purposeful and exciting. I learned a lot during/from this project, not just about design itself, but also about how I approach creative tasks and what kind of workflow works for me. Even though it was challenging at times, especially when ideas didn’t come easily, I’m glad I kept going. This experience confirmed that I really enjoy this type of work and want to keep growing in this direction. I'm excited to take everything I’ve learned here and apply it to future projects, and hopefully bring more of my own ideas to life through both design and storytelling.```
